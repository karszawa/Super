## Abstract

I work at Mercari as a Web Frontend Engineer.
I belong to the ITP team, which is responsible for the Item Transaction Page in Mercari App.
The Item Transaction Page in Mercari is the WebView application so that this application has relatively many dependencies rather than typical web applications.
One of the difficult thing in the application which has a lot of dependencies is "mocking."
In this slide, I describe what is the standard issue in the mocking in WebView application and how to solve it.
